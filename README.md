# Loan Qualifier Application
FinTech Module 2 Challenge

This is a command-line interface application for determining which loans the user qualifies for. The application works by taking in a `daily_rate_sheet` file  that has loan criteria from various loan providers, asking the user a number of questions to evaluate their loan eligibility, returning to them a list of qualifying loans, and allowing the user to save their results.
